# Spotify Mobile App Challenge  

## Layout

- The top left icon is to change how the list should be sorted. Two options are provided: order by year and order by province.

- the top right icon is to go to next page

## Enhancement 

I don't have a lot of time for this project and I keep updating during the break from my work

- Add order detail view when user taps each order summary cell
- Show pages on how view controller and add previous button to let user go back to previous page
- Add more sorting options (sort by items numbers, price, etc.)

## Use Case

I was assuming that end user will be the person who prepares customers' order at warehouse. Some sample user cases would be:
- check the name of the person who placed this order
- check address of this order
- check date of this order
- check total amount of purchases  

## Technology

- Written in Switch 3 
- No 3rd party libraries were used
- Core data is added for later implementations 
- background colours are randomly assigned
